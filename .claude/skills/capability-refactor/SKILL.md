# Capability refactor

## Start with the contract

- Resolve every repository-relative path below against the **Vesper repository root**, not this skill's directory (`.claude/skills/capability-refactor`).
- Always read **both** `doc/nucleus_capabilities.md` (canonical contract) and `doc/capabilities_implementation_plan.md` (checkbox plan) first, before analysis or edits. If either is unavailable, ask the user rather than inventing its contents.
- Preserve user and concurrent-agent edits to these documents; coordinate overlapping changes and make focused updates rather than replacing either document wholesale.
- Distinguish accepted contracts, proposals, open decisions, and implementation status. Existing code and unchecked plan items are not architectural approval.
- Use canonical `CoreType` numeric IDs, not legacy `ObjectType` constants. Preserve the canonical mapping; consult the contract and `CoreType` rather than copying full type/opcode/rights tables here. Core IDs include `Null = 0` and `DebugConsole = 127`; architecture-specific types use the high bit `0x80`.
- Treat disagreement between the contract, `CoreType`, and implementation as a discrepancy to resolve explicitly, not permission to silently renumber the ABI.

## Gate architectural decisions

Check the documents' decision status and dependencies for the selected item:

- **D1:** protection model and single-address-space design.
- **D2:** revocation.
- **D3:** ownership and lifetime.
- **D4:** authority, badges, and bootstrap.
- **D5:** domain control block (DCB).
- **D6:** memory and ASID management.
- **D7:** IPC and blocking.
- **D8:** time.
- **D9:** ABI evolution.

Resolve blocking decisions with the user before implementing dependent behavior. Present the concrete choice, consequences, and affected checklist item; never silently promote a proposal to an accepted contract.

## Pick one incremental slice

1. Read the user's requested scope, both documents, relevant module declarations, and the actual call chain from userspace encoding through syscall entry/dispatch to API and object operations and completion.
2. Inspect `kernel/nucleus/src/api`, `kernel/nucleus/src/objects`, `libs/object`, and `libs/syscall`; discover the relevant architecture and syscall-entry files by following declarations and calls.
3. Distinguish compiled, reachable behavior from excluded sketches. File presence does not mean implementation is active; never enable a sketch merely to make it compile or return fake success.
4. Select **one scoped checklist item** consistent with the user's request. Identify its prerequisites, decision approvals, acceptance criteria, and affected layers. Do not execute the whole backlog unprompted.
5. Preserve existing user and agent edits. For changed contracts, update the canonical document first after approval, then keep the plan consistent before changing code. Review-only work must not change checkboxes.
6. Implement the slice coherently: shared ABI definitions, userspace encoding/result decoding, checked rights and object transitions, and relevant tests together. Avoid half-migrated call sites or incompatible numeric representations.
7. Validate, audit the diff, and check off only verified completed tasks. Leave partial or blocked items unchecked and record the blocker; never mark unrun tests complete.

Respect the plan's ordering and explicit prerequisites:

1. Contracts, status audit, and decision approvals.
2. Shared ABI and host-testability.
3. Active console/syscall boundary.
4. Guarded capability storage and domain lifetime.
5. Memory vertical slice.
6. Deferred completion first, then notifications/event counts and endpoint + reply.
7. Time.
8. Final integration and documentation audit.

## Keep responsibilities separate

- **Shared ABI:** pure, host-testable definitions of IDs, operations, rights, layouts, encoding rules, and errors; no kernel state or hardware dependency.
- **Userspace (`libs/object`, `libs/syscall` as appropriate):** typed encoding, result decoding, ownership ergonomics, and transport wrappers. Phantom types improve ergonomics but are not a security proof.
- **Kernel API (`kernel/nucleus/src/api`):** checked decoding, capability lookup and authorization, and orchestration; do not hide object invariants here.
- **Objects (`kernel/nucleus/src/objects`):** state, lifetime, ownership, and invariant-preserving transitions.
- **Architecture code:** hardware mechanism, not implicit authority policy.
- **Syscall entry/transport:** marshal requests and results; perform transport completion only after object/capability guards are released. Keep deferred completion explicit rather than returning success before the required transition.

## Safety requirements

- Never fabricate lifetimes or references with unsafe code to bypass ownership or guard constraints; establish real backing-storage and domain lifetime guarantees.
- Prevent rights amplification across lookup, derivation, transfer, and invocation; validate authority in the kernel regardless of wrapper types.
- Preserve resources and ownership on pre-commit failure through validation/reservation and rollback. Where the approved contract permits irreversible partial completion, expose it explicitly with recoverable bookkeeping; never silently lose or duplicate resources.
- Reject malformed or unsupported user input with defined errors, not panics, unchecked indexing, or fake success.
- Keep authority, badges, lifetime, revocation, and blocking semantics aligned with approved decisions; expose unresolved assumptions instead of encoding them as defaults.

## Use project tooling

- Vesper uses **JJ for version control and `just` for build, test, lint, and related workflows**. Run recipes from the repository root.
- Read the current `Justfile` before selecting validation commands. Use `just --list` to discover public recipes and `just --dry-run <recipe>` to inspect expanded commands and prerequisites without executing them.
- This is a `no_std` embedded project: the recipes supply the custom target, `build-std`, board CPU/cfg flags, feature combinations, linker scripts, warning policy, and QEMU test runner. Do not reconstruct those commands by hand or substitute bare `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, `cargo check`, or standalone `rustfmt` for project validation.
- Run lint validation as **`just clippy`**. `just clippy-pre-push` is a smaller default-feature check, not equivalent to the full recipe. Use `just fmt-check` for formatting and `just lint` for formatting plus full embedded and host-tool linting.
- Use `just test` for the full test workflow, or a relevant documented subset (`just test-device`, `just test-chainboot`, `just test-host`). Currently `test-host` tests only `chainofcommand`, not the capability catalogue tests.
- Use `just build` with the recipe's documented board/features when needed; for example, `just build rpi3 qemu`. Consult the work plan's command table for scope and default behavior.
- If a focused ABI/host test lacks a recipe, propose adding one to `Justfile` as scoped work; do not silently bypass the convention. Treat explicitly approved ad hoc diagnostics as supplemental evidence, never as a replacement for the configured project checks.
- Inspect recipe dependencies and side effects. Do not run interactive/debug/flash/eject/setup/dependency-update recipes as validation; `just ci` starts with cleanup. In particular, `setup-local-dev` installs tools and changes Git hooks, contrary to the no-default-version-control-mutation rule.

## Validate and report

- Start with pure ABI tests (IDs, layouts, encode/decode, errors), then state/rights/lifetime models and failure atomicity, then relevant target/QEMU integration, all through appropriate `just` recipes. Match coverage to the slice and its acceptance criteria; narrower checks do not imply the broader workflow passed.
- Bound long-running commands with timeouts. Report exact commands, results, missing prerequisites, and timeouts; an unavailable target run is a validation blocker, not a pass.
- Before completion, compare changed contracts, code, tests, and plan status. Report the item addressed, affected paths, observed validation, remaining blockers, and next prerequisite without starting another slice.
- The user uses **JJ only**: no raw Git. Do not automatically perform version-control operations; use read-only JJ only if necessary. No commit/change creation, history mutation, branch/bookmark changes, or push by default, and no force rewriting.
