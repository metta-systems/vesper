This is our Code of Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”)

It is based on our values and aspirations (be good, innovate, work together, be part of the solution). It describes what we expect from the members of the community in three main rules:

1. Do the right thing. Always act with honesty, integrity, and reliability. Keep moral and ethical standards high.
2. Be nice. Treat people with dignity and respect, regardless of who they are and where they came from. Stay decent and courteous in all relationships.
3. Play fair. Don’t cheat. Be careful to account for and balance the interests of all groups (developers, artists and designers, end users and the general public).
